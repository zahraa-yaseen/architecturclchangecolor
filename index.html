        <h1> What is it Architecture</h1>
        <p>Architecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton "architect", from ἀρχι- "chief" and
            τέκτων "creator") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings or
            other structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural
            symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving
            architectural achievements.
            The practice, which began in the prehistoric era, has been used as a way of expressing culture for
            civilizations on all seven continents. For this reason, many people consider architecture to be a form of
            art. Over the years, the field of architectural construction has branched out to include everything from
            ship design to interior decorating</p>
